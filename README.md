# Ethnic Fractionalization and Conflict Shiny App

In my Political Analysis and Data Visualization Course, we conducted a research project that showcased all the skills we were taught in the semester. For our project, we analyzed ethnic fractionalization and conflict. The project maps out the levels of ethnic fractionalization and conflict in each country, visualizes and analyzes the relationship between the two variables through regression analyses. 

Research Question: Ethnic Diversity and Conflict: Are ethnically diverse countries more prone to conflict?
